/*
 * This example demonstrates how it is possible to create tags and trees of tags
 * easily using symfony2-style fluid programming. All the setX() methods return
 * an instance of the tag, the createChild() spawns a new child tag and adds it
 * to the current tag before returning the child tag. To get back into the
 * context of the parent tag, use end().
 *
 * This example also demonstrates how to assign a SdlDate to an attribute.
